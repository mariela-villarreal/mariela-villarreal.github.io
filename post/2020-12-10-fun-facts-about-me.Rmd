##Things I Find Interesting:

[Causal Loop Paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop). The one in the movie Somewhere in Time ruined the whole movie for me. I can't even think about it without getting annoyed. 


True Crime Documentaries. The episode titled "Sympathy for the Devil" of the show "I am a Killer" involved a murder that took place in my hometown (not proud of that, by the way). [Here](https://criminaldiscoursepodcast.com/laredo-ax-murders/) is some more info if you're interested. 

The story behind any song ever. Especially Fleetwood Mac- I live for all the Stevie/Lindsey drama!
