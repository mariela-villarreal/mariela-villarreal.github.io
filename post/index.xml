      <description>Here are some fun facts about me! Who am I? Height: 5&#39;1&amp;quot;
Hometown: Laredo, Texas
I hate spiders, but I force myself to watch the movie Arachnophobia every year.
I was a swimmer in high school. My events were the 500 m freestyle and the 100 m backstroke.
If I had three wishes, I would wish for the chance to go back in time and see Prince in concert, to have a pet sloth, and have to infinitely more wishes.</description>

      <description>Hello!! This is my first official blog post, and I am going to use it to show off a little bit. Throughout this class, I learned how to use R, and I loved it. Towards, the end of class, we learned Python. Although, I personally enjoy R more than Python, we can actually use both of these programs at the same time, which is awesome! In the R chuck below, I&#39;m going to be maniupulating some data from the &amp;quot;movies6&amp;quot; dataset from my second project.</description>
