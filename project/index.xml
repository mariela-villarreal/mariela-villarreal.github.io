      <description>Netflix in All Kinds of Weather Introduction For my project, I was interested in seeing if my Netflix watching habits were affected in the weather in Laredo, TX (my hometown).

      <description>What Makes a Good Movie? With this project, I sought to continue with the theme of my first project: movies. I found a great dataset containing the information for over 58,000 movies listed on IMDb (the internet movie database). For each movie, the title, length of the movie (in minutes), year it was made, budget (in US dollars), IMDb rating (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest rated movie), total user votes for that movie, other rating information, mpaa rating (PG, PG-13, R or NC-17) and genre were given.</description>
